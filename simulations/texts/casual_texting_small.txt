You coming to the party tonight?
If by party you mean my couch, then yes.

What’s the hold-up? You’re always late.
I’m giving everyone a chance to miss me. You’re welcome.

Did you even read the group chat?
I skimmed it, if that counts.

I don’t know why I bother asking you for help.
Me neither, honestly.

Can you please stop ignoring my texts?
Can you start sending more interesting ones?

Are you serious right now?
Always.

We need to talk.
Uh oh, should I be scared or just mildly terrified?
