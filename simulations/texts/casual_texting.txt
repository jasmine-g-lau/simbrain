You coming to the party tonight?
If by party you mean my couch, then yes.

What’s the hold-up? You’re always late.
I’m giving everyone a chance to miss me. You’re welcome.

Did you even read the group chat?
I skimmed it, if that counts.

I don’t know why I bother asking you for help.
Me neither, honestly.

Can you please stop ignoring my texts?
Can you start sending more interesting ones?

Are you serious right now?
Always.

We need to talk.
Uh oh, should I be scared or just mildly terrified?

You still owe me $20.
Oh good, I was worried I didn’t owe anyone money today.

Why didn’t you show up yesterday?
My bed was holding me hostage. It was intense.

You coming over or what?
Define "coming over."

That was your big idea?
Hey, you said it couldn’t get worse, and I proved you wrong.

You're impossible to deal with.
It’s part of my charm.

Can you bring snacks?
I am the snack, thank you.

You forgot my birthday.
Nope, just saving it for dramatic effect.

Where are you?
Mentally or physically?

Did you actually finish that?
Define "finish."

We should hang out more.
You couldn’t handle more of me.

You’re too much sometimes.
Thank you. I try.

What’s the plan?
Oh, I thought you liked chaos?

Are you mad at me?
Mad? No. Disappointed? Always.

What are you doing?
Procrastinating. It’s an art form.

Are you ever going to answer your phone?
Maybe, but where’s the suspense in that?

Wanna grab coffee?
Are you paying, or do I need to start a GoFundMe?

Why are you like this?
It’s a gift.

You never listen to me.
What? Sorry, I wasn’t listening.

You good?
Good is a strong word.

You coming over?
Maybe, if I don’t find something better to do.

What’s your excuse this time?
Oh, you know, I’m just too fabulous for public appearances.

Did you finish that thing I asked for?
I finished thinking about it.

How’s life?
Overrated, you?

You’re the worst.
And yet, here you are talking to me.

We should really catch up soon.
Define "soon." Like, in this lifetime?

Are you even paying attention?
Define "paying attention."

You didn’t text me back.
I didn’t realize it was a life-or-death situation.

What time are we meeting tomorrow?
Who said anything about me showing up?

You never take anything seriously.
Why start now?

Why are you so weird?
It’s called personality, you should try it sometime.

Are you even trying?
Define "trying."

You’re impossible.
Takes one to know one.

Why did I even ask you?
Honestly, that’s a great question.

You owe me big time for this.
Get in line.

I need help.
Same.

Do you ever sleep?
Only when I’ve exhausted every possible way to avoid it.

Do you ever stop talking?
No, and you love it.

Why didn’t you answer my call?
Because I’m terrible, obviously.

You’re such a mess.
It’s called being “relatable.”

How do you survive like this?
Pure skill.

What’s your plan for tomorrow?
Same as today, but with less enthusiasm.

You’re annoying.
It’s a gift.

Did you eat today?
Does coffee count?

You didn’t even try.
I tried... in my head.

Can we reschedule?
I was hoping you’d say that.

What’s your excuse this time?
I’m allergic to effort.

Did you forget again?
No, I just thought you’d enjoy a surprise.

Why didn’t you tell me sooner?
Because I knew you’d freak out, and I was right.

Are you avoiding me?
I would never... unless you’re about to ask for a favor.

Can you be serious for once?
No. Next question.

What’s your deal?
Currently? Indecision and snacks.

You owe me a drink.
I owe you several, let’s be real.

You missed it.
I like to think I’m fashionably late.

Are we doing this or not?
Depends. Do I have to leave my house?

Why are you like this?
Honestly, I’m still figuring that out.

Are you free later?
Define "free."

This is why we can’t have nice things.
And yet, we manage.

Do you ever stop complaining?
I’ll stop when I run out of things to complain about. So, never.

Are you even awake?
Barely.

How’s that project going?
Great, if "great" means ignoring it completely.

Are you okay?
Emotionally or physically?

How do you do it?
Mostly with caffeine and denial.

Did you really mean that?
I mean 40% of what I say. The rest is for fun.

What time are you leaving?
When I feel like it.

Can you stop being so cryptic?
I could, but where’s the fun in that?

What’s your problem today?
Same as every day: existence.

You’re never on time.
Time is a social construct.

You ready yet?
Define "ready."

Are we still friends?
That depends. Are you about to ask for something?

You look tired.
That’s my secret. I’m always tired.
